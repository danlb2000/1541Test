This is a 6502 program for testing the basic functionality of a Commodore 1541 disk drive. It is designed to be used with the Infotron IF65 a rather obscure 6502 in circuit emulator, although some people might still find the code useful.

It can be assembled using the DASM 6502 assembler, https://dasm-assembler.github.io/
